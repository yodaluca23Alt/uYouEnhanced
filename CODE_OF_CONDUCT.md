# Code of Conduct for This Repostory
If I verify a reported Code of Conduct violation, my policy is:

- Contributors are allowed to make patches only to the main branch, unless an additional branch is involved. This policy applies to the implementation of custom features/options, updated features/options, and grammar errors.

- uYouEnhanced does not support Localization pull requests. While it may seem like a sudden change, maintaining localization becomes challenging when the branch needs to be reset due to the changes from qnblackcat/uYouPlus repository. Therefore, it is difficult to preserve any localization changes that were added on uYouEnhanced since the fork/branch can get reset and takes too long to add them all back.

- The use of the name `uYouPlusExtra` is prohibited on the releases **v18.49.3-3.0.1** and beyond. The correct and updated name for the repository is `uYouEnhanced`.

- The Users **qnblackcat** and **PoomSmart** are prohibited from utilizing any new or modified code that was introduced in the uYouEnhanced fork, but I'll allow you to use submodules and I allow you to utize the code you made for this fork. but Violation of this rule from the ones I don't allow will result in appropriate consequences, including but not limited to account suspension, access revocation, or other disciplinary actions as deemed necessary by the project administrators. Furthermore, it is strictly forbidden to publicly share or showcase the content of this policy on any social media platforms. Any breach of this restriction may result in similar disciplinary actions. This was policy was made to keep any rejected features on uYouEnhanced.
